# AI-Powered Crop Analysis User Guide (Farm Doctor Bot)

## Overview

The AI-Powered Crop Analysis feature, also known as the "Farm Doctor Bot," leverages artificial intelligence to help you diagnose plant problems and receive actionable advice. By providing descriptions or images of your crops, the bot can offer insights into potential diseases, pests, or nutrient deficiencies.

## Key Features

*   **Intelligent Diagnosis:** Get AI-driven insights into common crop problems.
*   **Actionable Advice:** Receive practical steps and treatment plans tailored for small-scale farming.
*   **Contextual Understanding:** The bot is trained with knowledge relevant to Kenyan agriculture.
*   **Google Search Integration:** The bot can use up-to-date information for its advice.

## Accessing the Farm Doctor Bot

You can typically access the Farm Doctor Bot through a dedicated chat interface, often found on the dashboard or via a "Farm Doctor" or "AI Assistant" link in the main navigation.

## How to Use the Farm Doctor Bot

1.  **Start a new chat:** If you don't have an active conversation, initiate a new chat session with the bot.
2.  **Describe the problem:** In the chat input, clearly describe the symptoms you are observing in your crops. Be as detailed as possible.
    *   **Good examples:**
        *   "My kale leaves are turning yellow from the edges inwards."
        *   "There are small white spots on the underside of my spinach leaves."
        *   "My spring onions are wilting despite regular watering."
    *   **Bad examples (too vague):**
        *   "My plant looks sick."
        *   "Help my crops."
3.  **Upload an image (if available):** If the interface allows, you can upload an image of the affected plant or area. Visual information significantly improves the bot's ability to diagnose.
4.  **Send your message:** Click the "Send" button to submit your query to the bot.
5.  **Review the analysis:** The Farm Doctor Bot will process your input and provide a diagnosis and recommended actions.
6.  **Follow-up questions:** Feel free to ask follow-up questions for clarification or more specific advice.

## Important Considerations

*   **Initial Advice:** The bot provides intelligent suggestions. Always use your best judgment and cross-reference with local agricultural experts when making critical decisions.
*   **Regional Context:** The bot is designed with Kenyan agricultural context in mind.
*   **Privacy:** Be mindful of the information you share, especially with images.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Bot not responding:** Check your internet connection. If the issue persists, try starting a new chat session or report the issue.
*   **Irrelevant advice:** Try rephrasing your question or providing more specific details/images.
*   **Image upload issues:** Ensure the image format is supported and the file size is within limits.
