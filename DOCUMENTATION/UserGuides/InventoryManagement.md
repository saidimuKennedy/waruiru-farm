# Inventory Management User Guide

## Overview

The Inventory Management system in Waruiru Farm helps you keep track of all your products, their stock levels, and their categories. Effective inventory management ensures you always have enough produce to meet demand and minimizes waste.

## Key Features

*   **Product Listing:** View all your products with details like name, price, stock quantity, and category.
*   **Low Stock Alerts:** Identify products that are running low on stock to facilitate timely restocking.
*   **Inventory Reports:** Generate detailed reports of your current stock.

## Accessing Inventory Management

You can typically access Inventory Management from the Dashboard or through a dedicated link in the main navigation menu, often labeled "Inventory" or "Products".

## Using the Inventory Management Tools

### 1. Product List

The product list provides a comprehensive overview of all items in your inventory. For each product, you will see:
*   **Name:** The name of the product.
*   **Category:** The category the product belongs to (e.g., "Vegetables", "Fruits").
*   **Price:** The selling price per unit.
*   **Stock Quantity:** The current number of units available.
*   **In Stock Status:** A quick indicator of whether the product is currently in stock.

You can usually sort this list by various criteria (e.g., name, stock quantity) and use search/filter functions to find specific products.

### 2. Low Stock Alerts

The system highlights products that are below a predefined "low stock threshold". This helps you prioritize which items need to be re-ordered or harvested soon. These alerts might appear on the Dashboard or within the Inventory Management section itself.

### 3. Generating Inventory Reports

To generate an inventory report:
1.  Navigate to the Inventory Management section.
2.  Look for a "Generate Report" or "Download Report" option.
3.  Choose the **Format** for your report (e.g., CSV).
4.  Click "Generate" or "Download" to save the report to your device.

The report will typically include:
*   A detailed list of all products, their categories, prices, and current stock levels.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Incorrect stock levels:** Manually verify physical stock against system records. Ensure all sales and new harvests are accurately recorded.
*   **Products not appearing:** Check if the product has been correctly added to the system and assigned to a category.
*   **Report discrepancies:** Verify the data source and filtering applied during report generation.
